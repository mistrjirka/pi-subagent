/**
 * Tests for the stateful RPC transport (rpc-client.ts) against a mock
 * child process (test/fixtures/rpc-mock.js).
 *
 * Covers the two real transport bugs found in code review:
 *  1. concurrent commands must correlate by unique command id — a shared id
 *     (e.g. the agent id) lets a later command steal an earlier waiter and
 *     mismatches responses;
 *  2. raw stdout Buffer chunks must go through StringDecoder — decoding with
 *     toString("utf8") first corrupts multibyte characters split across chunk
 *     boundaries.
